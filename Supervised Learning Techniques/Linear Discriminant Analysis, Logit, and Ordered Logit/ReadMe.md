üìÑ README: HRData_LDA_Logit_Ologit_Model_Comparison.R 

üìå Script Purpose  
This R script compares three statistical models ‚Äî Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (Logit), and Ordered Logistic Regression (Ologit) ‚Äî to predict employee performance scores using HR aptitude data. It evaluates model performance and provides accuracy comparisons for each.

üìÇ Input Data
File: HRdata2groups.csv
Expected Columns:
PerfScoreID: Ordinal performance score (used as outcome for ologit, collapsed into binary for LDA/Logit)
MechanicalApt: Mechanical aptitude score
VerbalApt: Verbal aptitude score

üõ†Ô∏è Key Dependencies
Make sure the following R packages are installed and loaded:  
library(MASS)  
library(dplyr)  
library(caret)  
library(car)  
library(rms)  
library(glue)  


üß™ Modeling Steps    
1. Data Preprocessing   
The PerfScoreID is collapsed into a binary variable called CollapseScore:  
1 ‚Üí High performers (PerfScoreID > 2)    
0 ‚Üí Low performers (PerfScoreID ‚â§ 2)  

2. Exploratory Analysis
Correlation matrix and scatter plots  
Linear regression with multicollinearity check via VIF  
VerbalApt is removed due to high correlation with MechanicalApt  

üìà Modeling and Evaluation

‚úÖ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
Predicts CollapseScore using MechanicalApt  
Uses midpoint of group means as cutoff   

‚úÖ Logistic Regression (Logit)  
Predicts probability of satisfactory (CollapseScore = 1)  
Classification threshold: 0.5   

‚úÖ Ordered Logistic Regression (Ologit)  
Predicts the full ordinal PerfScoreID (4 levels)  
Uses the rms::lrm() function and fitted.ind predictions  
Maximum predicted probability used for group classification  

üìä Model Comparison Summary  
At the end, the script prints a comparison using glue():  
"Linear Discriminant Model Accuracy: ...% (2 prediction groups)"  
"Logit Model Accuracy: ...% (2 prediction groups)"  
"Ordered Logit Model Accuracy: ...% (4 prediction groups)"  

üîç Assumptions & Notes  
Only MechanicalApt is used as a predictor due to collinearity  
Assumes the CSV file is in the working directory  
Uses max.col() to classify the most probable performance score in ordered logit predictions

üßº To-Do / Improvements  
Add model diagnostics (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices)   
Consider cross-validation or train-test split for robustness
