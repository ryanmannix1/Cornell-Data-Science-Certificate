🏠 Home Offer Acceptance Prediction using SVM
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Linear kernels to model and predict whether a home offer will be accepted or declined. 
It includes data preparation, exploratory visualizations, model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis using 3D plots.

📁 Project Structure
├── acquisitionacceptanceSVM.csv       # Original dataset
├── Train_Test_Data_Split.RData        # Pre-saved train/test split for consistency
├── home_offer_svm.R                   # Main R script
├── README.md                          # Project documentation

📌 Key Features
-Loads and analyzes home offer dataset
-Splits dataset into training and testing sets (or loads pre-split data)
-Creates rich 3D interactive visualizations using plotly
-Trains SVM models with both RBF and Linear kernels using e1071
-Evaluates models using confusion matrices, accuracy, and precision metrics
-Visualizes correct vs incorrect predictions in 3D
-Compares performance between RBF and Linear models

🔧 Requirements
Ensure the following R packages are installed:
install.packages(c("plotly", "e1071", "dplyr"))

▶️ How to Run
Clone or download this repository.
Place acquisitionacceptanceSVM.csv and Train_Test_Data_Split.RData in your working directory.
Open and run the script home_offer_svm.R in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

📌 Notes
A pre-generated training/testing split is used to maintain consistency across model runs. If you'd like to generate your own split, uncomment the corresponding code section and set a seed for reproducibility.
Interactive plots require a compatible environment (e.g., RStudio Viewer or a web browser).
